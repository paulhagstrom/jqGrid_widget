	# Otherwise, set it to a hash containing :rows (initial number of rows displayed), e.g., :rows => 25
	# and :rows_options (a comma delimited string of options for the rows popup), e.g, :rows_options => '20,50,100'

	# :add_button => false will not.
	# :add_button => true,
	
	# :collapsed => true will start the table out in a "collapsed" state (just the caption bar showing)
	# :collapsed defaults to false
	# :collapsed => false,
	
	# :caption is what appears in the titlebar
	# if not set, this defaults to @caption if set, or 'Records' otherwise.
	
	# :initial_sort will set the sort the table is initially sorted with.
	# By default, it will be on the first column.
	# To pick a different column, say column 3, do this:
	# :initial_sort => @columns[2][:index]
	# :inital_sort => @columns[0][:index],
	
	# :url is the data source address.
	# By default it is the address to the _send_recordset state of the calling widget
	# You could set this to something else, but don't do this rashly.
	# Whatever this points to should actually return Javascript code, intended to stuff the incoming data into a
	# precache of data for later.  See the Javascript code in public/javascripts/jqgrid_widget.js.
